## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The reflection system is built with a modular architecture consisting of:

### 1. Error Categorization (`domain/reflection/error_categorization.py`)
- **ErrorCategory Enum**: Categorizes errors into SYNTAX, RUNTIME, LOGIC, DATA, PERFORMANCE, SECURITY, DEPENDENCY, UNKNOWN
- **ErrorClassifier**: Analyzes exceptions and categorizes them with confidence scores
- **ErrorAnalysis**: Detailed analysis including primary cause, contributing factors, suggested fixes, and severity assessment
- **CategorizedError**: Complete error information with categorization and analysis

**Key Features:**
- Pattern-based classification using regex patterns
- Context-aware analysis considering code and data
- Severity assessment and recoverability analysis
- Extraction of context clues (line numbers, variables, data characteristics)

### 2. Reflection Engine (`domain/reflection/reflection_engine.py`)
- **ReflectionEngine**: Core engine for comprehensive failure analysis
- **FailureContext**: Complete context information for analysis
- **ReflectionResult**: Comprehensive reflection output with suggestions

**Key Features:**
- LLM-powered root cause analysis
- Context-aware improvement suggestions
- Retry strategy assessment
- Learning insights extraction
- Confidence scoring

### 3. Pattern Detection (`domain/reflection/pattern_detection.py`)
- **PatternDetector**: Detects and learns from failure patterns
- **FailurePattern**: Represents common failure patterns with metadata
- **PatternMatch**: Matches between failures and known patterns

**Key Features:**
- Pattern similarity calculation
- Learning from failures (success/failure tracking)
- Pattern statistics and analytics
- Persistent storage of learned patterns

### 4. Context-Aware Analysis (`domain/reflection/context_analysis.py`)
- **ContextAwareAnalyzer**: Analyzes failures in context of data and query intent
- **QueryComplexity**: Classifies query complexity (SIMPLE, MODERATE, COMPLEX, ADVANCED)
- **DataCharacteristics**: Identifies data characteristics (size, sparsity, mixed types, etc.)
- **ContextualInsight**: Provides contextual insights about failures

**Key Features:**
- Query intent classification (exploration, filtering, aggregation, visualization, etc.)
- Data characteristics analysis
- Intent-implementation mismatch detection
- Alternative approach suggestions

### 5. Embeddings-Based Pattern Matching (`domain/reflection/embeddings.py`)
- **EmbeddingPatternMatcher**: Uses embeddings for semantic similarity
- **Pattern clustering and similarity matching**
- **Embedding caching for performance**

**Key Features:**
- Semantic similarity between failures and patterns
- Failure clustering based on similarity
- Enhancement of traditional pattern matching with embeddings
- Efficient caching system

### 6. Learning System (`domain/reflection/learning_system.py`)
- **LearningSystem**: Continuous learning from failures and successes
- **LearningRecord**: Records learning events for analysis
- **ImprovementSuggestion**: Structured improvement suggestions

**Key Features:**
- Recording of failure and success events
- Pattern-based improvement generation
- LLM-powered suggestion generation
- Learning analytics and insights
- Suggestion validation tracking

### 7. LangGraph Integration (`workflow/nodes/reflection.py`)
- **reflect_on_failure**: LangGraph node for failure reflection
- **reflect_on_success**: LangGraph node for success reflection
- **Integration with main workflow**: Updated routing logic

**Key Features:**
- Seamless integration with existing LangGraph workflow
- Automatic reflection triggering based on execution results
- State management for reflection results
- Conversation history integration

## üîÑ Workflow Integration

The reflection system is integrated into the LangGraph workflow as follows:

1. **Execution Node** ‚Üí Checks execution results
2. **Success Path** ‚Üí `reflect_on_success` ‚Üí `synthesize_results`
3. **Failure Path** ‚Üí `reflect_on_failure` ‚Üí `retry_with_reflection` OR `handle_error`

### Updated Graph Routing
- Modified `_route_after_execution` to automatically trigger reflection
- Added `_route_after_reflection` for post-reflection routing
- Integrated reflection results into conversation history

## üß† Key Capabilities

### Automatic Error Categorization
```python
# Example: KeyError gets categorized as DATA error
error = KeyError("column 'age' not found")
categorized = classifier.classify_error(error, code, context)
# Result: categorized.analysis.category = ErrorCategory.DATA
```

### Context-Aware Analysis
```python
# Analyzes query intent, data characteristics, and failure context
context_result = analyzer.analyze_context(
    categorized_error, query, code, dataframe
)
# Provides insights like "Visualization intent but missing plotting library"
```

### Pattern Detection and Learning
```python
# Detects similar failure patterns
patterns = detector.detect_patterns(error, query, code)
# Learns from resolution success/failure
detector.learn_from_failure(error, query, code, success=True)
```

### Embeddings-Based Matching
```python
# Finds semantically similar failures
similar = matcher.find_similar_patterns(failure_text, patterns)
# Clusters related failures
clusters = matcher.cluster_similar_failures(failures)
```

## üìä Learning and Improvement

### Continuous Learning
- Records all failure and success events
- Builds pattern database over time
- Generates improvement suggestions based on patterns
- Validates suggestions with real-world results

### Analytics and Insights
- Pattern frequency and success rates
- Error category distributions
- Query intent analysis
- Performance metrics tracking

## üîß Configuration and Storage

### Persistent Storage
- Pattern data: `data/reflection_patterns.pkl`
- Learning records: `data/learning_records.json`
- Embedding cache: `data/embedding_cache.json`

## üöÄ Usage Example

```python
from domain.reflection import ReflectionEngine, FailureContext
from infrastructure.llm.client import get_llm_client

# Initialize reflection engine
engine = ReflectionEngine(get_llm_client())

# Create failure context
context = FailureContext(
    user_query="Show average salary by department",
    generated_code="df['salary'].groupby('dept').mean()",
    execution_results=failed_results,
    data_schema=schema_info
)

# Perform reflection
result = engine.analyze_failure(context)

# Get insights
print(f"Error Category: {result.categorized_error.analysis.category}")
print(f"Root Cause: {result.root_cause_analysis}")
print(f"Suggestions: {result.improvement_suggestions}")
print(f"Should Retry: {result.should_retry}")
